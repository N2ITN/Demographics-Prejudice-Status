# Demographics-Prejudice-Status

This notebook examines data from the study 2016 "Answering Unresolved Questions About the Relationship Between Cognitive Ability and Prejudice"
(http://spp.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/07/27/1948550616660592.abstract).

The study aims to better understand patterns of prejudice relating to verbal test scores, but also yields interesting survey-based rankings of social groups in relation to their status, choice of membership, conservatism and ideology.

Thought the research offers some interesting conclusions of its own, this notebook examines the collected social ranking data using pandas, SQL, seaborn, and sklearn, and is accessible through mybinder.org
