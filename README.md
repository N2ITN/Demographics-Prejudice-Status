## Exploratory Data Analysis
This notebook explores survey data on attitudes towards various social groups from a recent study (more below).
These data are explored with Python libraries including pandas, SQL, seaborn, and sklearn, and plotly.

## Summary of the paper
The data source for this analysis is the 2016 study "Answering Unresolved Questions About the Relationship Between Cognitive Ability and Prejudice"
(http://spp.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/07/27/1948550616660592.abstract).
In order to examine patterns of prejudice relating to verbal test scores, the researchers collected survey-based rankings of participant attitudes towards certain social groups. Each participant's negative prejudices were compared to the target group's level of choice in membership, and to the participant's verbal score (intended a proxy for cognitive abiltiy). 

The study found that regardless of cognitive ability, all participants harbored prejudices towards other social groups. However, higher scoring individuals were more prejucided towards groups with higher degree of choice in membership, while low-scorers were biased against those with relatively low choice in membership. 


## Data used
The analysis featured in this Jupyter notebook uses only the survey data collected on attitudes towards target demographics, and does not use any of the verbal test score data.
